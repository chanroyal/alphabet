# alphabet
Node.js implementation of alphabet guessing game server.

## Setup

Easy:
```
npm install
node alphabet.js
```
Note: I had trouble getting dependencies to work on Node 11. All testing was done with Node 8.12.

## Playing

By default, the server listens on port 8080. Start the game and play with 

```
http://localhost:8080/alphabet/startgame
http://localhost:8080/alphabet/guess
```

Have fun!
